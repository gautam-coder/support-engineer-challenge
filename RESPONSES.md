#### Support Email Response

Hello! {Name}
I think this problem "pending v83 failed - Failed due to unhealthy allocations - not rolling back to stable job version 83 as current job has same specification"is related to the Virtual Machine count. The unhealthy allocation error means the app could boot but couldnâ€™t connect to our health checks.
Virtual Machine error is thrown when any internal error occurs or resource limitation which prevented.
Share the 'flyctl logs' and 'fly.toml' file then we can find the exact problems, Share the screenshot of the Command "flyctl releases list" to get more specific about the unhealthy issue.

Awaiting your response

Best Regards
Gautam
